**genericallyloud**:  
so I just had an interesting thought that I thought might be useful for people, not sure if someone has done this before there’s a lot of online courses and bootcamps and blogs etc. lots of places of getting information and learning lots of resources for self learners but something I haven’t really seen out there is something resembling a larger scale “curriculum” or roadmap to tie things together obviously there isn’t only one path

**kennethlove**: 
there’s Udacity’s nanodegree program and we have Tracks at Treehouse (and something else coming soon)

**tiffany.js**: 
I have been invited to the something else @kennethlove but I am waiting for it to expand

**genericallyloud**:  
yeah, that’s cool, but I expect its very isolated to those sites/services

**kennethlove**: 
@tiffany.js: awesome! let me know how it goes

**genericallyloud**:  
I’m talking about something that’s independent of the specifics

**kennethlove**: 
@genericallyloud: yeah, it’s restricted to the content from that provider, but so is a curriculum at a college
1  

**genericallyloud**:  
I’m not knocking it

**kennethlove**: 
no, it’d be nice to have a cross-provider list

**genericallyloud**:  
I’m saying that it seems like a resource which did nothing other than map out a roadmap and list potential resources at each node could be a valuable thing

**drakyula**:  
@genericallyloud, there’s http://www.theodinproject.com/
Learn Web Development for Free Using Ruby on Rails  |  The Odin Project
The Odin Project empowers aspiring web developers to learn together

**genericallyloud**:  
that’s very narrow and also very specific to that site/service (edited)

**drakyula**:  
Well, It’s a collection of links and information from all over, but I agree that it’s fairly narrow

**tiffany.js**: 
What is wrong with having a curriculum specific to a site/service @genericallyloud? Not sure I understand the problem

**kennethlove**: 
@genericallyloud: i get what you’re asking for. who would you see moderating that, though? someone has to vet the resources and progression

**jesus_castello**:   
I think it depends on what you want to learn and what kind of projects you want to work on. It would be really hard to have an 'universal' or 'generic' list of learning resources. (edited)
1  

**genericallyloud**:  
@tiffany.js: I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with it by itself. I’m saying there would be value to a larger scoped, service independent resource that is focused on the roadmap, and pointers to resources for each node it wouldn’t provide any actual content itself

**tiffany.js**: 
Got it

**genericallyloud**:  
because any site specific curriculum would only offer what it has available and that would always be limited @kennethlove: I think thats a very interesting question I don’t have an answer to it certainly couldn’t be a single person @jesus_castello: that’s why it would have to have several branching paths

**kennethlove**: 
crowdsourcing would get you at least part of the way there but that’s prone to bias, too

**genericallyloud**:  
one interesting approach would be splitting apart topics from “curriculum" so a topic would have a list of resources

**kennethlove**: 
unless, of course, you’re just interested in having a directory of materials that cover a given concept

**genericallyloud**:  
available wiki style

**kennethlove**: 
Yahoo! for learning

**genericallyloud**:  
and a “curriculum” is an arrangement of topics and there wouldn’t necessarily be a single definitive curriculum, people could make them, share them, upvote them etc. and draw from a pool of shared topics

**kennethlove**: 
you need to stop using the word “curriculum”, then :simple_smile: a curriculum goes from point A to point B if it’s just “here’s all of the stuff that talks about monads in javascript”, then it’s something else

**genericallyloud**:  
that’s the difference between a topic and a curriculum monads would be a topic

**claytonflesher**:  
I have a list of the 77 things you need to know before you start looking for a Ruby job. Written for me by @jeg2

**genericallyloud**:  
right, that could be turned into a curriculum made up of topics in a reasonable order the topics it contained would be reusable across curriculum

**claytonflesher**:  
http://calvyn82.github.io/2015/05/07/list.html
1  

**genericallyloud**:  
see, and that’s exactly the sort of thing that would be great to make and share, but then to be able to go a step further and have resources for each of those

**claytonflesher**:  
You're welcome to use it as a framework.

**genericallyloud**:  
well I’ve got my own list, I was more curious how useful such a thing would be for people and if it would be worth expending effort on it

**claytonflesher**:  
That list is chunked by category. I did not learn those 77 things in that order.

**alb**:   
@genericallyloud: There are also FreeCodeCamp, who offer curricula for Front-End and Back-End and this thing: https://bento.io/grid
Bento | Learn to code the way professional programmers do
Bento - Learn to code the way professional programmers do
Learn to code the way professional programmers do with a guided tour using curated, free coding tutorials on the web. Learn languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Rails, Node, and more. (371KB) **claytonflesher**:  
I found it very useful. Was able to keep track of my progress over time.

**genericallyloud**:  
although I’ll happily take the ideas you’ve got and contribute as well

**claytonflesher**:  
I had a printed out version that I checked off as I learned items.

**genericallyloud**:  
right, and that’s exactly how I would expect someone to sort of use it (edited)

**alb**:   
>  I was more curious how useful such a thing would be for people
IMO, a lot useful. Really ​*a lot*​. That feeling of being stuck and wondering "and now?" I think we all had (and keep having, probably) is caused by the lack of those "directions"

**genericallyloud**:  
to feel like they had a track to work from and to feel accomplished when they got to the end

**claytonflesher**:  
You have no idea how excited I was to check off the last item on that list.

**dees**:   
that's a good list, @claytonflesher -- and I, for one, appreciate the oxford comma being correctly used
1  

**claytonflesher**:  
:stuck_out_tongue: The Oxford comma always gets a mention.

**genericallyloud**:  
I mean, I remember 10 years ago looking back and thinking about how if I could rearrange which courses where offered in what order, and which to add or remove, I would do it very differently than what I actually did in college

**kennethlove**:

**programazing**:  
and I'm home!

**genericallyloud**:  
and now that I’m here on CodeNewbie and I find myself sometimes trying to give pointers to people, its one of the things I come back to

**claytonflesher**:  
I have never had a cs class. I'm mentor-taught, so having a list was super-useful for me knowing when to start looking for a job.

**genericallyloud**:  
If I developed a hypothetical new school curriculum, what would I want people to learn and in what order and again, there’s not just one path

**claytonflesher**:  
Depends on what it's a school for. web dev? language?

**genericallyloud**:  
but that notion of having a path, having a checklist

**programazing**:  
On the bright side the new memory works just fine though now I have to figure out some messed up system files.

**kennethlove**: 
is book- and expe**rim**: entation-taught. not the smoothest path

**genericallyloud**:  
having someone who’s learned it then try to lay out a path for the next person I just thought that would be a useful thing to share, and also something that other people would really be able to contribute their own lessons learned to because I certainly don’t know everything, I know a very small subset of that

**claytonflesher**:  
Also helps, imo, if your mentor has strong opinions. Especially if they're well-informed strong opinions. You get his/her prejudices, which actually served me quite well in the short-term.

**genericallyloud**:  
agreed, I think that does help

**claytonflesher**:  
Helps if you can rely on, I don't know why this is a bad practice, but I was told it was so I'll stop doing it.

**angeljose**:  
This is a good topic. I’m 1.4ish years into working as a dev. But I still feel there’s some big gaps. Working at a startup is not the ideal environment to learn best practices, etc. because of the speed that you have to iterate at. So I come here for mentorship, read for best practices, etc. But with a full time gig, there’s only so much extra time. :neutral_face: So a resources as what is being described above would help in keeping focus. That’s one thing I appreciated about the online bootcamp, or having a mentor with strong opinions… FOCUS. It’s so hard to not jump around from one thing to the next when learning on your own.

**alb**:   
@genericallyloud: Like a selection of various curricula to pick from. "Wanna be a JS back-end dev? Pick one of those" etc. Since there can be more than just one "path" to the final point, i think

**genericallyloud**:  
right

**claytonflesher**:  
I think the worst thing you can do when you start is jump from language to language. I see so many people doing it.
3  

**angeljose**:  
agree @claytonflesher

**alb**:   
Or at least, this is how I understand what you would want to do

**angeljose**: 
I tried doing that w/ JS, and I abandoned that. Now that I’ve revisited after understanding and working with ruby more, I realize that it makes it easier to go back and ‘understand’ what JS is doing the same / different.

**claytonflesher**:  
Yeah, you really need the painful grind of one language under your belt before you can grok another one's nuances. I find I'm reaching the point where exploring other languages actually helps me understand Ruby better. But it takes a while to get there.

**alb**:   
@claytonflesher: Great advice. Really. It takes too much time to learn and understand that learning a language doesn't mean anything on its own. You can learn a language in two weeks (if it's not enormous, or in a total different paradigm than what you are used to). What takes months and years is learning all the constellation of things around a language. Frameworks, engines, CMSes, technologies etc.

**genericallyloud**:  
I think the most important thing is actually doing enough with something that you really learn it/retain it

**claytonflesher**:  
There's learning the syntax of a language, and then they're learning the why and how of a language.

**genericallyloud**:  
that’s true about languages, frameworks, databases, etc a crash course in angular doesn’t help much you’ve got to build something enough that you hit pain points and work it out

**alb**:   
Totally

**claytonflesher**:  
Also, too many people learn the frameworks before they learn the language, which is also a mistake. If you can write a Rails app from a tutorial, but you can't tell me the difference between each, map and inject, and how to find it out in a few seconds, you're in trouble the first time you need to do something that isn't from that tutorial.

**dees**:   
I was instructed to learn rails before ruby, and well... here I am, but it was kind of painful.

**claytonflesher**:  
It can be done, but I think it's a mistake.

**kennethlove**: 
i learned django before python. it wasn’t a great idea

**claytonflesher**:  
Too much of it is magic.

**alb**:   
Am I the only one who started out with Pascal? :|

**kennethlove**: 
my first language was Logo, then BASIC

**alb**:   
Yeah that too, but I don't count them. QBasic was... awful? And logo is (was, I think it has long since died by now) a toy basically (edited)

jesus_castello  
I started with BASIC :simple_smile: But I didn't know what I was doing, just copy & type in the instructions from the manual that came with my computer lol.

**genericallyloud**:  
for me it was TI-BASIC, then Visual Basic 6 then C++

**alb**:   
I feel less alone now xD

**kennethlove**: 
logo, basic, javascript, actionscript, php, ruby, python, random tidbits of other languages as needed and, 20+ years later, programming is programming, every language is awesome and horrible.

**alb**:   
So, about that curricula thing? Was it just an idea for others to realize, or it's going somewhere? I find it really interesting

**genericallyloud**:  
I was actually considering trying to make it happen I was mostly trying to figure out if it was worth my time and get some feedback on how to make it the most useful

**claytonflesher**:  
@kennethlove: I am looking forward to the day when I think JS is awesome.

**alb**:   
I think it's definitely worth your time (or anybody's time with the ability to make it happen)

**kennethlove**: 
@claytonflesher: lol. my point is more that every language has goods and bads. the tribalism so many programmers throw around is pointless and destructive to our community

**genericallyloud**:  
well anybody looking for a project to learn on, come talk to me :simple_smile:

**claytonflesher**:  
Yes, all languages have they're strengths.

**genericallyloud**:  
I’d be happy to sort of project manage it/contribute but also use it as a learning experience itself

**alb**:   
I don't know, though, how much inclined would people be to pay for "directions". I mean, I can imagine people would think "oh, this just links to other resources and wants to be paid for it?". It's hard to understand the value behind correct directions

**genericallyloud**:  
for people who haven’t made a web app themselves before oh, it would be free I wasn’t thinking of it as a business venture

**alb**:   
...which is?

**genericallyloud**:  
this hypothetical curriculum thing I’m not out to make money, I just wanted to do something useful

**alb**:   
No I mean, what's "business venture"? :P

**genericallyloud**:  
"I don't know, though, how much inclined would people be to pay for "directions”." you said that, and I’m just saying it would be free just a resource online

**claytonflesher**:  
@genericallyloud: You should make it a github repo so people can contribute (edited)

**genericallyloud**:  
I was planning on it

**claytonflesher**:  
It would have built-in markdown support, and you could have tracks for different languages or career goals.

**genericallyloud**:  
yeah, so I’m trying to figure out what the different entities would be, and the vocabulary

**claytonflesher**:  
Well, first you have to come up with some pithy name so a startup can sue you for using it.

**alb**:   
LOL

**claytonflesher**:  
But only after your repo is required by half the internet

**alb**:   
Like Kik, and let the hell break loose again because of that xD

**claytonflesher**:  
Seriously, if the owners of Kik had any sense they'd change their name. Nobody in the tech community is ever going to want to work for them.

**genericallyloud**:  
oh, how about “CodeMap - the Roadmap for learning to Code"

**claytonflesher**:  
https://www.codemap.com/ Sure, these guys will be happy to sue you for using that one.

**genericallyloud**:  
lol

**angeljose**:  
LOL

**genericallyloud**:  
its even a registered trademark

**alb**:   
@claytonflesher: It's just the nonsense they do. In all the articles I read they always said the lawyers just threatened to sue, never really started anything. Because they know very well they'd have lost it. It's the same policy adopted by Apple. I read about them suing coffeeshops because they had the word "apple" on their sign

Something like that.

re: lawsuits over trademarks, the law is such that the trademark is invalidated if you don't defend it, so to have a trademark at all is to be in the business of suing or at least threatening anyone who possibly steps on it. it's stupid, but that's the system we have.

Basecamp puns in a Rails track is completely acceptable.

**kennethlove**:

**genericallyloud**:  
alright, well that sounds pretty settled ok, if I were to start a git repo on this soon, should I make a github org, or just a personal repo it really depends on how many people think they’d want to contribute

**alb**:   
You can start with a personal repo, and move it to an organization once there's a working prototype

**claytonflesher**:  
It isn't like you need private repos.

**genericallyloud**:  
no, but public orgs are free too its super simple to make one but Im happy to just do a personal repo for now we’ll see if I even execute on it it wouldn’t be the first time I was more ambitious than I had time for which is why I’d love help if people like the idea

**claytonflesher**:  
That's a project I'd be willing to contribute some to.

**genericallyloud**:  
especially people who are looking for a project to learn from

**claytonflesher**:  
Seems like the codenewbie community is about perfect for both users and contributors.

**genericallyloud**:  
agreed

**alb**:   
Depending on the technologies you decide to go with, I'd be really interested in contributing (or, more like ​_trying_​ to contribute, I don't think I would be of much help) (edited)

**genericallyloud**:  
I feel like JavaScript would probably be a good common denominator but I know a lot of people here do ruby a lot too

**claytonflesher**:  
Well, Ruby and JS aren't mutually exclusive Pretty much every complicated enough Ruby project uses JS.

**genericallyloud**:  
of course not, but it probably only needs one backend language

**claytonflesher**:  
I see.

**genericallyloud**:  
so either full stack JS, or ruby and JS

**claytonflesher**:  
I mean, I have opinions, but it's your project.

**genericallyloud**:  
I’m happy for it to not be ​*my*​ project I can easily advise and contribute and possibly manage the project without even being the main contributor

**claytonflesher**:  
If you're just linking to resources, seems like full stack JS would be overkill. Simple crud app makes more sense. If that. I might even just make it static or a wiki.

**alb**:   
You remove the game-ification this way (edited)

**claytonflesher**:  
True

**genericallyloud**:  
I think it could easily be a wiki, but then it wouldn’t have any of the features that would make it special it would just be another wiki

**claytonflesher**:  
Right, but a particularly useful wiki.

**alb**:   
And game-ification is known to be a powerful tool for creating habits and help learning/doing a lot of things (edited)

**genericallyloud**:  
it also depends if anyone actually wants to contribute as a way of learning I can certainly set up a wiki without writing any code and then just manage the wiki

**claytonflesher**:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product Even better than a wiki, make a Jekyll site that is hosted on github. That way uses make submissions through pull requests.

**genericallyloud**:  
well for me, a minimum viable product would be a jekyll site yeah

**claytonflesher**:  
It's all in markdown, which takes no time at all to learn.

**genericallyloud**:  
totally, that was my initial plan

**claytonflesher**:  
And anyone who can do basic git can contribute, regardless of their language. We always tell people who want to get started in open source to start with documentation, you'd have an ideal place for them to go to do just that. You could even have a 'getting started in open source' section that started them out helping on the site, and then pointed them to other projects that want documenters.

**genericallyloud**:  
I do think it would really need to be an app to reach its full potential. I’m dubious how much it would even get used until then. But I agree its certainly worth getting started there has anyone used jekyll like a wiki before? would it be even easier to just use the github wiki at first?

**claytonflesher**:  
A wiki would be good. I didn't realize it supported markdown until just now. The only downside is that you'll have to stay on top of the edits if you want anyone to be able to edit it in the browser.

**genericallyloud**:  
well its still git

**claytonflesher**:  
You can limit it to collaborators and pull requests

**genericallyloud**:  
exactly I just think there’s going to be a lot of interpage linking if it starts wiki style

**claytonflesher**: 
Yeah, I agree. Multiple tracks are going to have crossover content.

**genericallyloud**: 
right

**claytonflesher**:  
Lots of tracks would have git, version control, and basic shell navigation, for example.

**genericallyloud**:  
right I also think there should be a slightly higher level of sharing too like maybe a trail can have prereqs its “higher up the mountain” and requires taking other trails to get there without trying to stretch the metaphor too much, I guess

**alb**:   
> Lots of tracks would have git
Not all of them?

**genericallyloud**:  
I expect most of them

**claytonflesher**:  
Well, I was thinking more the shell navigation. Don't really need that one for .net

**alb**:   
By the way, a wiki still fails to have gamification, IMO

**genericallyloud**:  
of course its just the MVP, as @claytonflesher was saying its a good way of gathering content without investing too much code first

**alb**:   
Which means? Collecting the content before spending time in organizing it in a webapp?

**genericallyloud**:  
I think the code could happen in parallel for the real app version it builds up use cases lets you get feedback

**alb**:   
Okay, I see it now, it makes totally sense

**piecedigital**: 
Sooo... what're y'all building? A wiki?

**genericallyloud**:  
scroll up no well I mean, we’re considering using a wiki as a first pass before writing an app but scroll up for more details

**rim**:   
like wiki app?

**elee**:   
tl:dr?

**genericallyloud**:  
no, the app wouldn’t be a wiki

**claytonflesher**:  
Resource for people wanting to know what they need to learn to become developers. In whatever language

**genericallyloud**:  
and whatever area of coding knowledge it wouldn’t be the resources, it would point to the resources

**alb**:   
Curricula, roadmaps, organized and verified paths more than just resources

**genericallyloud**:  
and beyond that, it would provide a roamap for people trying to learn

**claytonflesher**:  
Right, kind of like a reference guide with links to resources that help you achieve that particular step.

**rim**:   
hmz like treehouse and something similar just points where to look? (edited)

**genericallyloud**:  
right so the idea is that it external to any specific site/platform it just provides the high level semi-ordered list of topics with pointers to where to learn them

**claytonflesher**: 
@genericallyloud: Should probably have some kind of flag to let people know if the link is to a payed or free resource.

**genericallyloud**: 
and several paths for people who have different interests yeah

**rim**:   
issue with programming new resources is not available old resources not very interesting any more

**genericallyloud**:  
?

**rim**:   
I mean if you stock old resources links that probably not going to help with new technologies and programing patterns

**genericallyloud**:  
well that’s part of the value that voting/moderation brings new resources can constantly be added for different topics and old ones that might not be good anymore would get pruned

**rim**:   
yeah I agree with that but you will add your time for updating everything :simple_smile:

**genericallyloud**:  
but depending on the topic, old resources are still great

**rim**:   
or you guys planing to hire someone to work all the time on it?

Nope, it's a free resource. Open source.

Power of community, you know

**claytonflesher**:  
works for wikipedia

**genericallyloud**:  
well that’s why it would have to be community driven

**rim**:   
not really works for wikiedia anymore every month less data are updated and added in wikipedia

**alb**:   
It works for all open source projects

I was reviewing recently but yeah if community will add value to it will be great

**genericallyloud**:  
eh - I’m not really too worried. it will grow and sustain if its really useful and if not it will die I mostly just wanted a place I could point people to for some of my own notes/thoughts but it seemed like something more universally helpful and much better if community driven
