**pawan92**: 
Awesome! So we would be creating a website?

**sufuninja**: 
joined #codehike

**sufuninja**: 
I’m down!

**genericallyloud**: 
yeah, so we would be making a website that I think would be really useful for a lot of the people on CodeNewbie  and it would be made ​*by*​ CodeNewbies  so that would be pretty sweet  it sort of just came out of an idea I had earlier today, and some people were interested, so it seemed like a good project  I’m going to try to write up some ideas tonight, we’ll see how far I get  hopefully we can start discussing ideas and can start executing on a plan soon  we can divvy up responsibilities  tasks

**sufuninja**: 
You could start a trello board.

genericallyloud 
yeah, I was going to do something like that  hadn’t decided exactly what  in what capacity would you like to participate?

**sufuninja**: 
I have used a few diff sites learning on my own and have a great perspective imo :slightly_smiling_face:

**genericallyloud**: 
yeah, that’s perfect

**sufuninja**: 
anyway I can. I have some frontend chops and never lack ideas

**genericallyloud**: 
I’ve been coding for about 15 years, so I’m less of a newbie - I was just hoping to make something helpful  love getting different perspectives and backgrounds  I’ve only done it one way :simple_smile:

**sufuninja**: 
I am currently attending an immersion school learning LAMP but find myself with time to work on my own stuff.

**genericallyloud**: 
would that be your ideal stack if you could pick (just trying to get feedback)? (edited)  or are you looking to broaden your horizons a bit?

**sufuninja**: 
I love javascript and really want to learn angular react node mongo…. yeah.

**genericallyloud**: 
ok, cool  that’s more the road I was thinking  although I’m willing to go with what the group wants honestly if people want to step up and do a lot of the work

**sufuninja**: 
I have access to a co-op workspace here in San Antonio and could ask around for other perspectives and maybe some online learning success stories or failures. What has worked or not worked

**genericallyloud**: 
yeah, I mean, there’s really two pieces here  the content - the resources and “trails” etc  and then the app itself

**pawan92**: 
I'm fairly new. I've been learning js through FCC and have dabbled in react and ruby through udemy. Know HTML and Css pretty well. Trying to put js and HTML/Css together is what I need experience in

**genericallyloud**: 
it would be good to get some content together as sample data to have use cases

**pawan92**: 
My 2 cents I know quite a few sites which provide all the resources for newbies it would be interesting to create some cool website that could help/co tribute something. There are quite a few awesome projects under github explore

**genericallyloud**: 
@pawan92: I think you’re missing the point of the site

it doesn’t have the resources  it points to the resourcesbut it guides people along a fuller path to get where they want to go in their learning experience  and being a third party, it isn’t confined to the resources of a single site  I’ve talked to a lot of people on CodeNewbie, and even people who aren’t newbies, and they don’t always know what they should be doing next, what is the best way to reach their goals

**pawan92**: 
ahh ok. yes that could work. have you heard of the odin project? thats a similar free camp that has all the resources gathered but it points to outside resources

**genericallyloud**: 
or even what different possible areas they can go

**pawan92**: 
theres also this list i came across: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome
 
GitHub
sindresorhus/awesome
A curated list of awesome lists  makes sense. im down to try. id love to get some contribution experience and help out in any way possible

**genericallyloud**: 
look, there’s a ton of stuff out there  none of it that I’ve seen is doing what I’m describing  the odin project, for example is very limited

**sufuninja**: 
@pawan92: thats a cool list though!

joined #codehike

**sufuninja**: 
That is the tough part. I knew I wanted to develop software, I just didnt know what or how.

**genericallyloud**: 
right

**sufuninja**: 
So I learned python

**pawan92**: 
@genericallyloud: i see what your saying.

**sufuninja**: 
and thought okay..  now what  I made a game like asteroids…now what

**genericallyloud**: 
right, exactly

**sufuninja**: 
I cant get a job doing that

**pawan92**: 
@sufuninja: did you go through any camps?

**sufuninja**: 
FCC  Codecademy  udemy  coursera

**pawan92**: 
ok nice im working thru that now. i did some codecademy as well and udemy.

**sufuninja**: 
Im not done with FCC  but I like their approach

**genericallyloud**: 
and I mean, I think the odin project is actually a really great piece of sample data  its basically one “trail"  what I want to enable is for other people to make trails

**pawan92**: 
yea. and they provide great resources imo

**sufuninja**: 
yeah, like even knowing what to learn next. PHP or react or MySQL

**genericallyloud**: 
and many of the topics in there could certainly be reused by other trails  but you could sub in PHP instead of ruby, for example  I mean, the odin project is very opinionated

**pawan92**: 
but most of us who are starting out wont know how to blaze our own trails. we dont know that much about software which is why we depend on these camps in the first place

**genericallyloud**: 
and I also think the odin project goes into far more detail than I would want

**pawan92**: 
unless you come in with a set goal and language you want to learn

**genericallyloud**: 
right, there would be different kinds of users  people with more experience would make the trails  other people would follow them

**sufuninja**: 
I am slowly finding out what I like about developing myself!  OH that’s cool

**genericallyloud**: 
but with good community feedback, you could upvote trails that worked well and provide feedback for possible changes  if you found good resources for a particular topic, you could add them so other people would see them

**sufuninja**: 
Even trails left by rockstars like Kyle Simpson. What learning path did he take?

**genericallyloud**: 
sure  here’s another datapoint

**pawan92**: 
i like the idea. im willing to try it out. its open source on our time and 0 cost. we can host on github itself and eventually move to a domain if need be

**genericallyloud**: 
this is something @claytonflesher mentioned while we chatted today  http://calvyn82.github.io/2015/05/07/list.html  so while I don’t think this is the format you would ultimately want, I think this is the kind of thing which is really valuable

**sufuninja**: 
wow  yeah

**genericallyloud**: 
for him, it was basically a checklist of all the things he needed to know in order to be a Ruby developer  now imagine taking that checklist and turning it into a trail that was a little more ordered  and had links for each of those things  I think we have to play around with the granularity a little - figure out the right size  I think that’s going to be one of the more interesting parts of the design process  what are the entities we want

**sufuninja**: 
start small right. Just start with the first thing.

**genericallyloud**: 
what is the smallest atomic piece? what is the think which resources are attached to  I’ve been calling that a “topic"

**sufuninja**: 
nice  that was hard for me in the beginning

**genericallyloud**: 
how big is a topic?

**sufuninja**: 
i knew i didnt want to build webpages for the babysitter down the street

**genericallyloud**: 
is git a topic? ruby? error handling?  ruby seems too big

**sufuninja**: 
git IS a topic

**genericallyloud**: 
well, my point is granularity

**sufuninja**: 
npm

**genericallyloud**: 
should git be a topic, or is it too big to be a topic  is git a “trail"

**sufuninja**: 
I wasted a whole day trying to figure out what went wrong

**genericallyloud**: 
as in, a list of topics

**sufuninja**: 
sudo install vs install

**genericallyloud**: 
does that make sense?  lol

**sufuninja**: 
a whole day  I didnt know there was a difference  total sense Git seems like a topic on a trail because what is it until you realize you need it right?

**genericallyloud**: 
so I think there should be a level above trail too

**sufuninja**: 
and then you only need a little

**genericallyloud**: 
and I don’t know if I’m stretching the metaphor, or it starts to get lame  but you could have a “hike"  which is made up of trails

**sufuninja**: 
my bad ideas feed the good ones lol

**genericallyloud**: 
so look at the odin project

**sufuninja**: 
there might be base camps

**genericallyloud**: 
that whole thing would be a hike

**sufuninja**: 
supply cach

**genericallyloud**: 
each part under that (ruby programming) would be a trail  and then trails would be made up of...  I was saying topic, but if we’re getting thematic  markers?  vistas? (edited)  blazes? (the hiking lingo word for trail markers)

**sufuninja**: 
switchbacks  I like markers or milestones

**genericallyloud**: 
leg  milestones is pretty good  so my thought is that milestones are basically global  like a wiki entry

**sufuninja**: 
a sign describing the terrain ahead

**genericallyloud**: 
a minimal description and a ton of links to resources

**sufuninja**: 
what to expect at the end.  what can I do if I make it there?

**genericallyloud**: 
and I think there’s a lot of room here for ratings and reviews on the linked resources

**sufuninja**: 
like yelp, looking for a good park

**genericallyloud**: 
then a trail would be something that a user makes which is composed of milestones  but there can be a lot of people reusing the same milestones to make different trails

**sufuninja**: 
would the user inter that or would the app track it

**genericallyloud**: 
even very similar trails

**sufuninja**: 
enter*  would you star the link?

**genericallyloud**: 
so let’s say I wanted to make a trail about learning javascript  I would make a new trail, name it, and then put together a list of milestones  I could reuse existing milestones or make new ones if they don’t exist  I could make recommendations for links in milestones  so lets say closures are a milestone  for my trail, I would add that milestone, and then I could recommend one or two particular resources from it

**sufuninja**: 
I got ya

**genericallyloud**: 
and I expect there’s probably be some room to write a trail specific guide with some explanation for each milestone

**sufuninja**: 
I have an early start. This sounds fun!

**genericallyloud**: 
then a hike is one level higher  it would be made up of trails  so trails can be reused in hikes  so then once trails and hikes are ready, they can be made public, and other people would “hike” them  so my vision there would be that people would have their own account and they would basically “start” a hike  and that would make a checklist for them  and they would have an easy way of traversing the milestones, checking them off as they go and giving feedback

**sufuninja**: 
One could still need a ‘guide’. Like where to go from here?=> try this trail

**genericallyloud**: 
yeah, so there’s all kinds of social stuff you could do from there

**sufuninja**: 
and that would be the checklist

**genericallyloud**: 
basecamps to meet other people following similar trails as you  you could be “trail buddies"

**pawan92**: 
Milestone is what free code camp had before. Theirs was also a trail so you want to make sure the idea is not plagiarising or something

**sufuninja**: 
if a checklist was upvoted, that’s where I would go  I really like the trail buddy  I could give my trail a kick-ass trendy name

**genericallyloud**: 
some people might take the role of “trail guides”, assisting hikers

**sufuninja**: 
like moderators

**genericallyloud**: 
@pawan92: they don’t get to own camping/hiking metaphors

**sufuninja**: 
haha  its really about the network/platform anyway. There isn’t a predefined curriculum. Just a network of trial and error. What worked for me

**genericallyloud**: 
yeah, its just about helping people find their way to getting where they want to go/learning what they want to learn  FCC is a subset of that  odin project is a subset of that  college is a subset of that :wink:

**sufuninja**: 
FCC was great for teaching but then I would goto codecademy and really just practice. Codecademy didnt ‘teach’ me much but it was great to reinforce what I knew

**genericallyloud**: 
its just a different way of organizing resources that are already out there, but providing more of a path  if FCC didn’t get you all the way there, it was obviously missing something  if you figure out what it was missing, you’ve got a great hike in the making
