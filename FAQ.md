###What is Code Hike?

CodeHike is a site we're developing to help people who are trying to learn more
about coding. Whether it be someone who is learning to code for the first time,
or just someone who is expanding on their skills, CodeHike is about providing
people guided experiences to get toward their goals.

###Who is the target audience (kids, grandparents, stay at home moms, high school/college students looking to try out coding)?

There can be many target audiences and customized hikes for them. Hikes should have
meta-data that would help people find the right hikes for them. Different ages,
backgrounds, experiences, and learning styles means there's no such thing as a
one size fits all path to learning. CodeHike is trying to accommodate that by
harnessing the community to blaze trails and highlight the most useful ones.

###Will there be pre-prescribed paths, or will you list resources grouped by skill level (like intermediate Python)

I think there are a lot of ways of highlighting paths and guiding hikers to the
ones that will be the most useful. Meta-data about each hike (similar to a real
trail guide) would be important and useful. I think there are other ways beyond
that, such as a social aspect. If you can find other people with similar background
(knowledge base/experience), you can find things they recommend.

###Will it be sorted by language, or structures (OOP vs web scripts)

So there are different levels in the design of CodeHike: hikes, trails, and steps.
(Hikes contain trails, trails contain steps, steps point to resources)
A trail might be "beginning ruby", or "git", or "understanding classic OOP". Trails
cover a single topic at about the level of a single course in school, or possibly
a section of a course in school. It doesn't have to be language specific, but it
might be. That's why a rich meta-data system is necessary. And also why there
wouldn't only be one sorting or grouping mechanism. A hike would be larger,
containing multiple trails that might span multiple languages (ruby and js for example).
Even a step could be cross language (possibly, not sure yet) if it relates to a topic
that applies to multiple languages, and in that case the resources would have to
be tagged with the language.

###How will you handle someone who wants to just promote their paid service (for example what if Treehouse or Code School wanted to just promote their service)

I don't see that as a problem, in fact, I think there could be some useful synergy
there. I think it would be important for those hikes/trails/resources to be properly
marked so people knew what they were getting into, but I don't think it would
really pollute the whole system as long as we have good mechanisms in place for
people to find what they want. I don't think its scaleable to rely on low volumes
of content to make the system manageable.

###Is their room for sponsorship from companies like Treehouse and Lynda to help pay the server/hosting costs, and is that even needed

I think at first I can certainly pay for it myself as I don't anticipate the costs
to be very high right away. Long term, yes - I was actually thinking that having
"sponsored hikes" be a totally viable option as and potentially good solution to
costs as long as it was easy to distinguish.
