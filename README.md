# codehike
A guide for finding paths and resources in the quest for climbing up code mountain! (learning how to code)

There are 2 phases planned for thise project. Phase 1 is a [simple wiki](https://github.com/genericallyloud/codehike/wiki) (in fact, it is the github wiki for this project). Phase 2 is an actual web app with user accounts, database, community moderation, gamification, etc.

See the [initial discussion](https://github.com/genericallyloud/codehike/wiki/Initial-CodeNewbie-discussion) for more details.
